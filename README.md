# Cryptocurrencies-Unsupervised Machine Learning by Kieran Persaud

## Overview of the Challenge

Martha is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting. Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. They've asked for a report to be created that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system.

Unsupervised machine learning is useful for this purpose, since we don't know the output and since we want to create a classificatio system. In the challenge, I will first pre-process the data to fit the machine learning models using PCA. I will employ KMeans to cluster the cryptocurrencies, and then create a visualization using ```plotly.express``` that can easily depict the different groups.
